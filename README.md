# Students Score Analysis

## Introduction
The data below was collected randomly from a sample of students in a class to determine the students performance in grade two. The sample of the data collected is for 10 students out of 40 students in the class and is assumed to represent the performance of the whole class. The data collected consist of the age of the students and the scores of the students in different subjects; mathematics ,science ,English, and history.

## Objectives
The following were objectives of our analysis
1. To determine how age affects performance of students
2. To determine performance of students across different subjects

## Conclusion
In summary, implementing a target approach  to examination analysis and benchmarking will provide insights into the students performance by focusing on the subjects strengths and weaknesses. This strategy will enhance academic excellence  and continuous improvement  in our education.

 ## Recommendations Summary

Subject-Specific Examination: Analyze specific topics within each subject to identify causes of variability. Focus on subjects with lower averages or high score variability. Highlight strengths (e.g., Science, English) and address weaknesses.
Benchmarking & Comparative Analysis: Compare class performance with other classes or past years to identify trends. Use the mean to gauge average performance and standard deviation to assess consistencyâ€”lower deviation suggests consistent performance, while higher indicates variability.
Outlier Analysis: Identify outliers and determine if external factors or personal issues explain extreme scores. Provide targeted support for struggling students and offer advanced opportunities for high achievers.
